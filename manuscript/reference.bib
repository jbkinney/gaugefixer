  abstract = {Gene regulation is one of the most ubiquitous processes in biology. However, while the catalog of bacterial genomes continues to expand rapidly, we remain ignorant about how almost all of the genes in these genomes are regulated. At present, characterizing the molecular mechanisms by which individual regulatory sequences operate requires focused efforts using low-throughput methods. Here, we take a first step toward multipromoter dissection and show how a combination of massively parallel reporter assays, mass spectrometry, and information-theoretic modeling can be used to dissect multiple bacterial promoters in a systematic way. We show this approach on both well-studied and previously uncharacterized promoters in the enteric bacterium Escherichia coli. In all cases, we recover nucleotide-resolution models of promoter mechanism. For some promoters, including previously unannotated ones, the approach allowed us to further extract quantitative biophysical models describing input–output relationships. Given the generality of the approach presented here, it opens up the possibility of quantitatively dissecting the mechanisms of promoter function in E. coli and a wide range of other bacteria.},

  abstract = {Allosteric communication between distant sites in proteins is central to biological regulation but still poorly characterized, limiting understanding, engineering and drug development1–6. An important reason for this is the lack of methods to comprehensively quantify allostery in diverse proteins. Here we address this shortcoming and present a method that uses deep mutational scanning to globally map allostery. The approach uses an efficient experimental design to infer en masse the causal biophysical effects of mutations by quantifying multiple molecular phenotypes—here we examine binding and protein abundance—in multiple genetic backgrounds and fitting thermodynamic models using neural networks. We apply the approach to two of the most common protein interaction domains found in humans, an {SH}3 domain and a {PDZ} domain, to produce comprehensive atlases of allosteric communication. Allosteric mutations are abundant, with a large mutational target space of network-altering ‘edgetic’ variants. Mutations are more likely to be allosteric closer to binding interfaces, at glycine residues and at specific residues connecting to an opposite surface within the {PDZ} domain. This general approach of quantifying mutational effects for multiple molecular phenotypes and in multiple genetic backgrounds should enable the energetic and allosteric landscapes of many proteins to be rapidly and comprehensively mapped. An approach that combines deep mutational scanning with neural network-based thermodynamic modelling is used to provide comprehensive maps of the energetic and allosteric effects of mutations in two common protein domains.},

The essential function of many proteins that fold into a specific structure is their ability to bind to a ligand, which can be assayed for thousands of mutated variants. However, binding assays do not distinguish whether mutations affect the stability of the binding interface or the overall fold. Here, we introduce a statistical method to infer a detailed energy landscape of how a protein folds and binds to a ligand by combining information from many mutated variants. We fit a thermodynamic model describing the bound, unbound, and unfolded states to high quality data of protein G domain B1 binding to {IgG}-Fc. We infer distinct folding and binding energies for each mutation providing a detailed view of how mutations affect binding and stability across the protein. We accurately infer the folding energy of each variant in physical units, validated by independent data, whereas previous high-throughput methods could only measure indirect changes in stability. While we assume an additive sequence-energy relationship, the binding fraction is epistatic due its nonlinear relation to energy. Despite having no epistasis in energy, our model explains much of the observed epistasis in binding fraction, with the remaining epistasis identifying conformationally dynamic regions.},
